# React Learning Repository

This repository contains all the React code through which I learned various key concepts of React by following online tutorials. Each learning module has been separated into its own folder, allowing you to explore individual topics or concepts in isolation.

## Structure

Each module of learning is organized into a dedicated folder within directory. These folders correspond to specific topics or lessons covered during my React learning journey. 

### How to Run a Specific Module

If you want to run a particular module:

1. Navigate to the folder and find the `src` corresponding to the concept you want to explore.
2. Copy the contents of the desired folder into the main `src` folder of your React project.
3. Ensure any required dependencies or packages related to that module are installed.
4. Start the React project using:

   ```bash
   npm start
